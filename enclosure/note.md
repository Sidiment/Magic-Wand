# Enclosure Design Notes

## Concept
The enclosure is designed as a bottle that appears normal at rest but transforms into a magic wand when used. This dual-purpose design enhances user interaction and adds a playful element to the project.

## Materials
- 3D printed bottle-shaped casing
- LED for visual feedback
- Battery for power
- MPU6050 sensor for gesture detection
- ESP32 microcontroller

## Design Decisions
- The bottle shape allows for easy handling and storage.
- The transformation mechanism is triggered by the gesture detection system.
- The LED provides visual feedback when the wand is activated.

## Battery
- A rechargeable battery is used to power the ESP32 and LED.
- The battery is securely housed within the bottle casing to ensure safety and longevity.
